# This lists all of the incomming and outgoing flows

# A human readable description
description = "Person 1's regular salary per month"
# The category this flow will apply to. This doesn't
# apply to individual assets but whole categories instead.
# This minimizes the complexity with needing to transfer.
# If you do want a transfer you will need to make a one-off
# flow that subtracts from one and adds to another. This is
# something we could make easier in the future if necessary
category = "cash"

# A start/end which can either be a explicit year and month or
# it can be one of the named times in your times_file (see plan.toml
# and times.toml for details)
start = { year = 2022, month = "January" }
end = "retirement"
frequency = "Monthly"

# You can use toml syntax for putting this under the value
# object but you can also explicitly list it in the top block
# if you want. An example of that is in the next flow
["Person 1 Salary".value]
# The different value types represent the various ways in which
# a value of a flow can be defined. So far we support things like
#  - fixed: An unchanging value like a fixed loan repayment
#
#  - rate: A percentage of the value of the flow. Useful for
#          investments like the stock market or 401k etc.
#
#  - table: Read the value of this flow from a table. This is
#           useful for known payments that vary over time
#           eg. new stock vests or "house maintenance" which
#           varies by year.
#
#  - rate_table: A combination of table and rate. This allows you
#                to have a variable rate over time. This is useful
#                for having say your stock growth changes get more
#                concervative in later years.
#
#  - units_table: Define a number of units and determine the value
#                 the value of those units based on the values in
#                 the accompanying table. See Person 1 RSUs below.
#
# Each of these have their own parameters and for now the best place
# to find out what those are is either to try it and you will get the
# required fields listed to you or you can read
# financial_planning_lib/src/input.rs specificially FlowValueRate enum
type = "fixed"
value = 5_000

# Same thing for tax as value. You can list this in it's own section
# or you can put it inside (example below). This block represents the
# tax withholding and taxability of the income.
["Person 1 Salary".tax]
# The type of tax policies that you can have for a flow. They are listed
# in financial_planning_lib/src/input.rs specificially FlowTaxPolicy enum.
# As of writing this the following as supported:
#
#   - fixed_rate: A fixed tax rate of X% being withheld and all of the money
#                 is taxable income. This is useful for things like stock
#                 and bonuses which are taxed at some fixed rate.
#
#   - partially_taxed: A partially taxed asset which lets you withhold some
#                provided percentage of only a part of the income from the flow
#                with the rest being untaxed. An example is a managed fund which
#                you are taxed on the gains from rebalancing and also any dividends
#                but not on unrealized cap gains.
#
#   - no_withholding: No tax is withheld but it's still all taxable income.
#                     This is useful for things like investments which might
#                     not hold tax for you
#
#   - tax_exempt: This marks the flow as non-taxable income eg tax payments,
#                 some 401k flows etc.
#
# Right now some obvious ones are missing like tax withholding calculated
# automatically for salaries, making negative flows tax exempt or even deductable
# and others. If you need these feel free to make an issue or a PR.
